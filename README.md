## Loves me ...? Generative Art Installation

Description:
A series of flowers, each with a randomly generated number of petals, simulate the game ["he loves me, he loves me not."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_loves_me..._he_loves_me_not)
 One flower is displayed at a time. Petals are picked off one-by-one, and a corresponding message of “[he, she, they, I] loves me” or “[he, she, they, I] loves me not” is shown, culminating in a final answer when the last petal is picked off. 

Hardware Materials:
* TTGO T1 board with built-in ESP32 microcontroller 
* USB-C to USB-C cable 
* Laptop with USB-C port

Installation Materials: 
* Envelope
* [Rechargeable Battery](https://www.makerfocus.com/products/4pcs-952540-3-7v-1000mah-battery-with-jst1-25-connector-lithium-rechargeable-battery)
* Hole puncher
* Electric drill
* Tape
* Thread
* Popsicle Sticks (2) 
* Pencil, eraser, colored pens, colored pencils 

Process: 
1. Connect TTGO T1 board to laptop via USB-C to USB-C cable. Set up Arduino IDE by selecting “TTGO T1” for board and the correct USB-C port. 
2. Develop program (found in repo) in Arduino IDE.
3. Upload code to device.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until graphic looks right (see in blogpost the technical challenge of drawing petals)
5. Draw Yoshi design on envelope with pencil, then go over with colored pens (Note, at time of installation, only colored pens were available - second image is post-installation, colored in with colored pencils).

6. Drill a small hole in the middle of each popsicle stick.

7. Use the hole puncher to punch 2 holes in the envelope - one in the top left corner, and one in the top right corner.
8. Cut 2 pieces of thread of equal length. Decide length based on how far you want the device to hang from the ceiling.
9. Designate the 2 popsicle sticks to correspond with each of the 2 holes in the envelope. Similarly, designate the 2 pieces of thread with each of the 2 sticks/holes. Tie one end of each thread into its designated popsicle stick and the other end into its designated envelope hole.

10. Hang the device by slotting the popsicle sticks into the ceiling air vent!
